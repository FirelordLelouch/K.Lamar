      <h2>Overview</h2>

He began to gain recognition in 2010, after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, he independently released his first studio album, Section.80, which included his debut single, "HiiiPoWeR".

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He was raised in a working class African American family, lived in Section 8 housing, and was reliant on welfare. Lamar developed an interest in music when he was four years old after listening to the hip hop records his parents would play at their house parties. He was given the nickname "Man-Man" as a child because he carried himself as an adult. When he was five years old, Lamar witnessed his first murder while sitting outside of his apartment unit. When he was eight years old, Lamar saw rappers Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre film the music video for their single "California Love" in his neighborhood. He described himself as being quiet, shy, and observant in school; his mother stated that he was a loner until the age of seven. He was introduced to poetry by his English teacher Regis Inge, who connected the literary form to hip hop. He graduated from Centennial High School in 2005 as a straight-A student.</p>
